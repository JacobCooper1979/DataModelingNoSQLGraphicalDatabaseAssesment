A spokesperson said the institute had not yet determined the extent of the breach.  (ABC News: David Weber) Link copied Share article The Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research in Perth is investigating a major cyber security incident. The institute confirmed it had identified a 'cyber incident impacting our internal servers'. But a spokesperson for the institute would not comment to the ABC on a report that a ransomware 'gang' had stolen data and was demanding $500,000. In a statement, the institute's spokesperson said it had immediately engaged experts and advisers in cyber security to 'guide our response' and 're-establish secure network access to our facilities'. The institute was taking steps to work with law enforcement and privacy regulators. The nature and the extent of the data that had been affected had not yet been determined, the statement said. 'The safety and privacy of our employees, researchers, tenants and supporters is our first priority.' The spokesperson said more should be known in the coming days."

Ticketek says no customer accounts have been accessed in the breach. (AAP Image: James Ross) Link copied Share article In short: Ticketek Australia says its customers' names, emails and dates of birth may have been accessed in a data breach.The announcement comes just days after rival company Ticketmaster was reportedly attacked by a hacker group which stole customer information. What's next? Ticketek says it is notifying customers who may have been impacted, and is working with the National Office of Cyber Security. Ticketek Australia says the names of some of its customers, as well as their dates of birth and email addresses, may have been accessed in a data breach. In a statement on Friday, the company said the information in question was stored in a cloud-based platform hosted by a 'reputable, global third-party supplier'. The company said it had secure encryption methods in place for customer passwords, and no customer accounts or payment details had been compromised in the 'cyber incident'. Inside the cyber blackmarket Photo shows Hacker in front of the computerHacker in front of the computer ABC Investigation uncovers large swathes of confidential material widely available on the open internet, ranging from sensitive contracts to privileged legal advice about a student's death. 'Since our third-party supplier brought this to our attention, over the past few days we have worked diligently to put every resource into completing an investigation so that we can communicate with customers who may have been impacted, and other stakeholders, as quickly as possible,' the company said. 'We have already commenced notifying those customers who may have been impacted. 'We apologise for any concern that this news may cause — we will provide further updates as more information becomes available.' News of the data breach comes days after the Department of Home Affairs confirmed it was working with Ticketmaster, a rival ticketing agency owned by US company Live Nation, to investigate claims of stolen customer information. There is no evidence the two potential incidents are related. Australia's National Cyber Security Coordinator, Lieutenant General Michelle McGuinness, said on Friday evening that Ticketek had advised her of the potential breach, and the Australian Signals Directorate and Australian Federal Police were also aware of the incident.

Here's what to do Photo shows A computer with hacking software on the screen and someone's hands typing on the keyboardA computer with hacking software on the screen and someone's hands typing on the keyboard Around 2 million Australians may be caught up in the Ticketmaster hack. Here's what you should be looking out for, and how to protect yourself from hackers and scammers. Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said that the breach potentially affected many Australians, based on the information she had so far, but reiterated that the data was likely limited to names, dates of birth and email addresses. She said the number of recent breaches demonstrated the importance of companies quickly alerting customers affected by data breaches, and offering them support. 'I'd ask Australians to be especially vigilant and on the lookout for scams during a time like this … including phishing emails,' she said. 'Be on the lookout for suspicious emails and contact cyber.gov.au for support and to report incidents. 'Don't click on any links in emails you aren't absolutely sure about, and if you receive an uncharacteristic email or text, be extra cautious in dealing with it.'"

    "article_text": "Queensland water supplier Sunwater targeted by hackers in months-long undetected cyber security breach By Rory Callinan  Topic:Water Thu 11 Nov 2021 Thursday 11 November 2021 The overflow area of Fairbairn Dam Sunwater owns and manages 19 dams across regional Queensland, including Fairbairn Dam in Central Queensland. (ABC Rural: Meg Bolton) Link copied Share article Queensland's largest regional water supplier, Sunwater, says it was targeted by hackers in a cyber security breach that went undetected for nine months. Key points: The Auditor-General's 2021 water audit found hackers gained access to a water provider's servers No customer or financial information was stolen in the breach, the auditor said  Three of six water authorities still had 'control weaknesses' in their systems, the report found It has been revealed that hackers left suspicious files on a webserver to redirect visitor traffic to an online video platform last year. Sunwater admitted the cyber breach after the tabling of a Queensland's Audit Office report into the state's water authorities, which mentioned the incident but did not say which authority was targeted. Following questions from the ABC, Sunwater confirmed it was the authority affected by the breach revealed in the Audit Office's report. A Sunwater spokesperson said no financial or customer data had been compromised and immediate steps had been taken to improve security once the unauthorised access to an online content management system was detected. 'Sunwater takes cyber security very seriously and acknowledges the findings in the Queensland Audit Office report,'' it said. The Water 2021 report stated the cyber breach had occurred between August 2020 and May 2021 and involved unauthorised access to the entity's web server that stored customer information. The report found 'threat actors' had targeted an older, more vulnerable version of the system. The webserver contained suspicious files that increased visitor traffic to an online video platform, the report said. A dam wall near mountains. Seqwater, which operates Wivenhoe Dam, said its systems hadn't been compromised. (Supplied: SEQWater) It noted weaknesses in the system had allowed the cyber breach to remain undetected for nine months. Six water authorities including Seqwater, Sunwater, Urban utilities, Unitywater, Gladstone Area Water Board and the Mount Isa Water board were examined in the report, which warned of vulnerability in information systems. Deficiencies in internal controls including relating to funds transfer payment information, were also highlighted. The 36-page report called for immediate action to fix 'ongoing security weaknesses in information systems'. It noted in the case of the cyber breach, measures had been taken to fix the issue including updating software, using stronger passwords, and monitoring incoming and outgoing network traffic. The report said despite the audit office last year recommending that entities strengthen the security of their information systems, not all had acted to address the issue. It said three of the six entities still had 'control weaknesses' on June 30. Multiple issues found in internal controls The report also highlighted problems with some internal controls, finding 24 deficiencies in the sector. These related to the access of electronic funds transfer payment information, security of supplier and employee information, and in one case, deficiencies in a review of the effectiveness of property, plant and equipment. One authority was found to have three deficiencies in relation to management of user access across financial, invoicing and payroll systems, the report noted. It said entities should only assign employees the minimum access to perform their jobs. Under the heading 'Further Action Needs To Be Taken', the report said cyber attacks were a risk with ongoing changes in entities' working environments due to COVID-19. Responses to the issues had been received from the entities involved to correct the issues raised, the report stated.

(ABC News: Giulio Saggin) Flood damages The report also noted the liabilities from the 2011 south-east Queensland floods class action when flood victims sued the state government, Sunwater and Seqwater. Seqwater was no longer liable for damages from the class action after successfully appealing the court judgement, the report said. [Qld local edition teaser] However, Sunwater's settlement was $80 million lower than estimates in its 2019-20 report, the auditor found. That financial year, Sunwater estimated its liability from the floods would be $330 million. The report stated the water sector's profits had increased by $234.7 million for the 2020 to 2021 financial year. The sector's total shareholder returns were $497.2 million, which was made up of dividends paid to Queensland government shareholders, a portion of the water distributor-retailers' profits paid to local governments, and income tax equivalents paid by commercial operations in government instead of tax. A shot of parched, brown land. The report noted that parts of Queensland are still in drought. (ABC Rural: Melanie Groves) Another issue flagged by the report was Queensland being affected by extreme weather conditions with 34 councils fully drought declared. It also noted the state's water recycling system that treated wastewater effluent from Brisbane and Ipswich at three water treatment plants remained in 'care and maintenance' mode, meaning it was not used at full capacity during the last financial year. However, purified recycled water from the scheme was used in power stations in place of water from dams.

Service NSW says it's been caught up in a 'criminal attack' on its cyber security. (Four Corners: Cyber War) Link copied Share article More than 180,000 New South Wales residents are believed to have been caught up in a major cyber security breach after a state government department was compromised earlier this year. Key points: Service NSW began investigating the breach in May after staff emails were compromised in April NSW Police are investigating who accessed the sensitive information Opposition MP Sophie Cotsis criticised the Government for taking months to inform customers Service NSW on Monday morning confirmed the large number of people likely impacted in the breach which was first reported publicly by the Government in May. Those caught up in the 'criminal attack' are now set to be informed by the department via registered post in the coming days. Service NSW chief executive Damon Rees confirmed the scale of the incident in a statement, saying millions of documents may have been compromised. 'The investigation, which began in April, engaged forensic specialists to analyse 3.8 million documents in the accounts,' he said. 'This rigorous first step surfaced about 500,000 documents which referenced personal information.' A man wearing a suit stands outside a Service NSW shopfront. Service NSW's Damon Rees says 500,000 documents contained personal information. (ABC News) Mr Rees said the data comprised documents such as handwritten notes and forms, scans, and records of transaction applications. 'Across the last four months, some of the analysis has included manual review of tens of thousands of records to ensure our customer care teams could develop a robust and useful notification process. 'We are sorry that customers' information was taken in this way.' 'It shouldn't take four months to notify people' The incident was discovered after the email accounts of 47 staff members were first compromised in April. Requests by ABC News under freedom of information laws for more information about the breach were rejected by the department in July, on the grounds an investigation was ongoing. NSW Police are actively involved in the investigation to determine who accessed the sensitive information.

(ABC News: Josh Bavas) Opposition MP Sophie Cotsis said the breach was 'unprecedented'. 'It is extraordinary that this attack has been allowed to happen. 'Whether it's births, deaths and marriages, registration, guardianship information — today people should be questioning whether they trust the information that they're providing to the Government and the security measures that the government is taking to keep their information safe.' She also criticised the Government for taking four months to alert residents. 'This is extraordinary — this is four months and they haven't notified people,' she said. 'The last we heard is that they're going to [use] registered mail notification, I mean that's outrageous. 'It shouldn't take four months to notify people whose information has been leaked and cyber criminals have access to that information.'

    "article_text": "China link possible in cyber attack on Australian Parliament computer system, ABC understands By political reporter Stephanie Borys Topic:Government and Politics Fri 8 Feb 2019 Friday 8 February 2019 Two police officers walk past the front of Canberra Parliament House. The sky is bright blue. Security authorities are investigating a cyber-attack on Australia's Federal Parliament. (AAP: Lukas Coch) Link copied Share article Australia's security agencies are investigating a cyber breach of the Federal Parliament's computer network that the ABC understands is likely the result of a foreign government attack. Key points: Authorities are yet to uncover any evidence that data was stolen in the breach Computer passwords were reset as a precaution as investigations continue The hackers were caught in the early stages of gaining access to the system, sources say The agencies are looking into whether China is behind the incident. In a statement, Federal Parliament's presiding officers said authorities were yet to detect any evidence data had been stolen in the breach. One source said the response to the attack had been swift but the hackers were 'sophisticated this time around'. Computer passwords have been reset as a precaution as the investigations continue. 'We have no evidence that this is an attempt to influence the outcome of parliamentary processes or to disrupt or influence electoral or political processes,' the Parliament's presiding officers said in a statement. 'Accurate attribution of a cyber incident takes time and investigations are being undertaken in conjunction with the relevant security agencies.' The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) is working to secure the network and says action was taken as soon as the breach was detected. 'The necessary steps are being taken to mitigate the compromise and minimise any harm,' ASD said in a statement. A cyber security expert warned about the seriousness of the breach. 'If you look at what goes on in Parliament House, you've got politicians, you've got staffers, you've got government departments that are moving in and out of the organisation and a lot of that is through electronic means,' adjunct professor Nigel Phair, from the University of Canberra, said. 'If I was a nation state, or dare I say any hacker looking for state secrets, this is the crown jewels.' Prime Minister Scott Morrison said no Federal Government departments or agencies had been targeted in the attack. But he refused to offer details on the breaches at Parliament House. 'I don't propose to go into any sort of detailed commentary on the source or nature of this,' Mr Morrison said. 'Once further information is available then we will be in a position to provide further detail.' Hackers caught in early stages, ABC told Sources have told the ABC that the hackers were caught in the early stages of gaining access to the computer network. The incident has been compared to a robber breaking into a house, whereby authorities know the front door has been broken but are yet to find out if anything else has been taken, or if there is another way to break in. The attack does not affect the computer systems of government ministers and their staff, however it does affect government backbenchers, the Opposition and crossbenchers. Labor politicians and staff said access to their emails had been intermittent since the attack. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said he was satisfied with the response so far. 'I've had some briefings on it. I'm satisfied from what I've heard initially that our security agencies and the president [of the Senate] and the Speaker [of the House] have moved in the right way to make sure that our parliamentary networks are secure,' he said. Mr Shorten described the breach as a 'wake up call', saying while Parliament had the resources to respond to a cyber attack, many small and medium-sized businesses did not. 'They don't have the budget of the Parliament of Australia. If I'm prime minister I'm going to invest a lot more in the cyber security of our small and medium sized enterprises.'"

The Australian Border Force's Cape Class Patrol Boats were built by Austal Australia. (Supplied: Austal Australia) Link copied Share article Western Australia-based Defence shipbuilder Austal has been the subject of a cyber security breach and extortion attempt. Key points: A hacker tried to sell some of the stolen Austal information online and extort the company after a cyber breach Austal says there is 'no evidence' that information affecting national security was stolen The Federal Police and Australian Cyber Security Centre are now investigating The company announced to the stock exchange last night that its Australian data management system had been targeted by an 'unknown offender'. Some staff email addresses and mobile phone numbers were accessed, according to the statement which acknowledged that a 'small number' of customers had been affected. It said it appeared the offender tried to sell some of the stolen material online 'and engage in extortion'. 'The company has not and will not respond to the extortion attempts,' it said. The company, which builds patrol vessels and frigates for the Australian Navy, said there was 'no evidence to date that information affecting national security has been stolen'. But it indicated the hackers got access to — or stole — drawings and designs of its ships. 'Ship design drawings which may be distributed to customers and fabrication sub-contractors or suppliers are neither sensitive nor classified,' it said. Austal has defence contracts with several other countries, including the US, but said the breach was limited to Australia. 'The data breach has had no impact on Austal's ongoing operations,' it said. 'Austal's business in the United States is unaffected by this issue as the computer systems are not linked.' The Federal Police and Australian Cyber Security Centre are investigating. In a statement, the Defence Department said it was aware of the breach but confirmed: 'No compromise of classified or sensitive information or technology has been identified so far.' 'This incident reinforces the serious nature of the cyber security threat faced by the defence industry, and the need for industry partners to put in place, and maintain, strong cyber defences.' Austal joins a growing list of companies, government agencies and institutions being targeted by cyber criminals seeking to steal information or disrupt operations. While it was unclear who was behind this latest attack, Duncan Lewis, the head of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, recently highlighted the growing threat to Australia's national interests of 'espionage and foreign interference'. According to its website, the Australian shipbuilder has designed and constructed more than 300 vessels for more than 100 operators in 54 countries. These include the littoral combat ship for the US Navy and the high-speed support vessel for the Royal Navy of Oman. Austal designs, constructs and maintains the Cape Class Patrol Boat program for Border Force and the Royal Australian Navy, as well as the Guardian Class Patrol Boat for the Commonwealth of Australia."

(Colonial Pipeline via Reuters) Link copied Share article One of the United States' major fuel pipeline operators has shut its entire network after a cyber attack on that involved ransomware. Key points: Sources believe the cyber attack has been carried out by a criminal organisation Colonial runs more than 8,000km of pipelines in the US, and provides almost half of the fuel for the country's east There are worries petrol prices may soar ahead of the US summer driving season Colonial Pipeline, the source of nearly half of the US east coast's fuel supply, said they had engaged a cyber security firm to help the investigation and contacted law enforcement and federal agencies after the attack. While the US government investigation is in early stages, one former official and two industry sources said the hackers were likely a professional cyber criminal group. The former official said investigators were looking at a group dubbed DarkSide, known for deploying ransomware and extorting victims while avoiding targets in post-Soviet states. Ransomware is a type of malware designed to lock down systems by encrypting data and demanding payment to regain access. 'Colonial Pipeline is taking steps to understand and resolve this issue. At this time, our primary focus is the safe and efficient restoration of our service and our efforts to return to normal operation,' the company said. US government bodies, including the FBI, said they were aware of the situation but did not yet have details of who was behind the attack. Colonial Pipeline graphic The Colonial Pipeline stretches from Texas to New Jersey, and spans more than 8,800 kilometres. (AP) US President Joe Biden was briefed on the incident, a White House spokesperson said, adding that the government was working to try to help the company restore operations and prevent supply disruptions. The incident is one of the most disruptive digital ransom operations ever reported and has drawn attention to how vulnerable US energy infrastructure is to hackers. The Department of Energy said it was monitoring potential impacts to the nation's energy supply, while both the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Transportation Security Administration told Reuters they were working on the situation. 'Grave threat' after hack Photo shows An aerial shot shows a large building with composite columns surrounded by trees and other large buildingsAn aerial shot shows a large building with composite columns surrounded by trees and other large buildings Investigators are working to uncover the depth and extent of a cyber intrusion into the computer systems of several vital federal agencies. 'We are engaged with the company and our interagency partners regarding the situation,' CISA executive assistant director of the cybersecurity Eric Goldstein said. 'This underscores the threat that ransomware poses to organisations regardless of size or sector.' Colonial transports 2.5 million barrels per day of gasoline and other fuels through 8,850 kilometres of pipelines linking refiners on the Gulf Coast to the eastern and southern United States. It also serves some of the country's largest airports, including Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson Airport, the world's busiest by passenger traffic. 'This is as close as you can get to the jugular of infrastructure in the United States,' according to Amy Myers Jaffe, research professor and managing director of the Climate Policy Lab. 'It's not a major pipeline. It's the pipeline.' Fears petrol prices will soar ahead of US summer The American Automobile Association said a prolonged outage of the line could trigger increases in petrol prices at the pumps, a worry for consumers ahead of summer driving season. A shutdown lasting four or five days, for example, could lead to sporadic outages at fuel terminals along the US east coast that depend on the pipeline for deliveries, according to Andrew Lipow, president of consultancy Lipow Oil Associates. 'As every day goes by, it becomes a greater and greater impact on Gulf Coast oil refining,' he said. 'Refiners would have to react by reducing crude processing because they've lost part of the distribution system.' Colonial previously shut down its gasoline and distillate lines during Hurricane Harvey, which hit the Gulf Coast in 2017. That contributed to tight supplies and petrol price rises in the United States after the hurricane forced many Gulf refineries to shut down. Reuters"

    "article_text": "Cyber security chief says MediSecure data breach is an 'isolated' attack but warns health data a prime target for cybercrime By Audrey Courty Michael Atkin, Brisbane based reporter for 730 By Michael Atkin Topic:Cyber Crime Fri 17 May Friday 17 May Has Video Duration: 3 minutes 56 seconds. Watch 3m 56s Cyber security chief says large-scale MediSecure data breach is an isolated attack. Link copied Share article In short: Australia's cyber security chief says the latest online ransomware attack is an 'isolated' incident and that no other entities were impacted.She says an investigation is underway to determine whether identity documents and Medicare cards were compromised, with affected customers to be notified if that is the case.  What's next?  Australians are told to take basic precautions against cyber attacks, like updating their software and using complex passwords. Australia's Cyber Security Coordinator says the large-scale ransomware data breach of e-script provider MediSecure was an 'isolated' attack, though she warns cyber criminals are likely to target the health industry again.  The company, which facilitates electronic prescriptions and their dispensing, did not reveal how many Australians were affected. Script provider MediSecure at centre of 'large-scale ransomware' data breach Photo shows Cyber hackingCyber hacking National cyber security coordinator Michelle McGuinness says the Australian Federal Police is also looking into the breach. Lieutenant General Michelle McGuinness confirmed that last week's 'significant' data breach contained Australians' personal and health information.  An investigation is underway to determine whether identity documents and Medicare cards were compromised. We believe it's an isolated incident, and that no other entities are impacted,' she told ABC News Breakfast on Friday morning. When asked who was behind the ransomware attack, the lieutenant general said she would not provide further detail on that matter. MediSecure pulled its website on Tuesday, saying it was gathering more information and that 'early indicators suggest the incident originated from one of our third-party vendors'. Lieutenant General McGuinness said there was no indication that any information from the data breach had been shared or published yet. 'We have not seen evidence so far to suggest that anyone needs to replace their Medicare card,' she said in a statement. 'If our investigation turns up any evidence to suggest Australians' identities are at risk and they need to replace their documents, we will let them know.' Lieutenant General McGuinness said authorities were working closely with MediSecure to be 'prepared and best postured' to support anyone whose information was compromised.  A photo of a finger touching a key on a laptop. Australians are advised to update their software and use complex passwords. (Getty Images) However, president of the Australian Medical Association Steve Robson said he attended a briefing on Friday and the scale of the cyber breach is not yet fully known.  'It is early days,' he said.  'It's not clear exactly what data have either been accessed stolen, blocked or whatever and these things can be complex. 'I think the scale of what's happened is going to take time to fully be revealed.' He said e-prescriptions went through a massive explosion over the last few years. 'Certainly MediSecure were a large part of that group,' he said.  'So we would anticipate that many doctors and many patients around the country will have data in the database.' Do you know more about this story? You can securely contact Elise Worthington on eliseworthington@protonmail.com Lieutenant General McGuinness said those affected by the breach did not have to take any action right now and would be contacted by MediSecure if their personal information is released. 'We do not recommend that anyone pays ransom — that just builds a cycle with the criminals,' she said. 'It provides financing for further ransoms and there is no guarantee that we get the data back or that the data is shared anyway.' Health data will 'continue to be targeted' The cyber security chief said authorities at the state and federal level were continuing to investigate the breach and were monitoring the situation to reduce harm. 'MediSecure has been incredibly transparent and working very closely with all stakeholders to ensure we get the best outcome for Australians,' she said. But the lieutenant general warned the latest data breach will probably not be the last. 'We'd be naive to think we won't continue to be targeted, particularly the health industry,' she said. 'It [has] data rich information, particularly sensitive data, and criminals will continue to respond.' She said some basic precautionary measures that every Australian could take to prevent data breaches include updating software, applying multi-factor authentication and using unique and complex passwords. 'These are things that will lift our cybersecurity posture as a nation and make us more secure,' she said.  She said the government was also working to build its cyber 'resilience' against attacks and to ensure its ready to rapidly respond to any data breaches.  Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind told the ABC this incident is a reminder privacy protections across the Australian economy are not where they should be. 'For me, this is a reminder that this is a live issue and that the Australian community are deeply affected through these kinds of incidents, and that we need legislative reform to meet the challenges of this new era.' She said the Privacy Act needs to be expanded to cover small businesses as currently 95 per cent of Australian businesses don't have any privacy obligations.  'That needs to change, and my office requires more powers to investigate and to enforce privacy infringements,' she said.  'Currently, we're limited to seeking civil penalties from the federal court in specific incidents where there's serious and repeated interferences with privacy. 'And we'd like to see the scope of those powers expanded to enable us to enforce lower-tier penalties.' She said that privacy reform is urgent. 'This is now a feature of our day to day lives, and we need to make sure that protections for personal information are commensurate with that new threat.' Associate Professor in Law and Justice for the University of New South Wales, Katharine Kemp, says it is concerning that there is not more funding to combat privacy breaches.  'It is concerning that in this latest budget, the funding for the OAIC has been cut, by about $11 million at a time when privacy risks and harms are only increasing.' 'All kinds of risks' Given the ongoing investigation, it is not yet clear what the impact from the MediSecure data breach will be on affected Australians. The chief executive officer at the Consumer Policy Research Centre, Erin Turner, said a medical data breach can put people 'at all kinds of risks if it is available to bad actors'.  Optus data breach class action Photo shows Signage on a store window reading 'OPTUS YES'Signage on a store window reading 'OPTUS YES' Slater and Gordon lawyers say they will pursue 'substantial' compensation for up to 10 million current and former Optus customers whose data was exposed in the recent hack. 'That can be everything from identity theft. If there's enough information there they could, for example, take out loans in your name,' she said. 'Or in other quite terrifying situations, your information may be used against you or to manipulate you, to scam you, to be held against you.' Ms Turner said all Australian companies needed to make better plans for communicating data breaches with customers. She said 'vague and unclear' statements from companies were not enough. 'This is yet another large-scale data breach where the people affected don't yet know. They don't know what data of theirs might be captured,' she said. 'They're just left in an anxious, horrible state waiting for this to be confirmed.' According to the centre's research, half of Australians did not know what to do when their data was breached. 'If you're caught up by this, you can go to the company and if you're unhappy, you can go to the OAIC [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner], the regulator for this issue,' Ms Turner said. She added it was 'really disappointing' that Australian laws around data breaches did not address what customer care operations needed to take place after an incident. 'We've seen again and again, whether it's Qantas, Optus, now MediSecure, there's very little information about what affected customers can do or should know.' The ABC has sent MediSecure detailed questions but has been directed to its website for updates."

Key points: National legal firm HWL Ebsworth was hacked by a ransomware gang in May The ABC has confirmed WA data held by the firm could be compromised Exact details are not known and an investigation is underway Earlier this month ransomware gang AlphV claimed to have published a trove of data from national law firm HWL Ebsworth on the dark web. In a statement to the ABC, the Insurance Commission of WA (ICWA) confirmed it was among the firm's clients and may have had its data compromised, but is being blocked from assessing for itself whether that's the case. The Commission provides insurance for all cars registered in WA, as well as self-insurance for the government including workers' compensation, property and liability. 'The details of the data that has been accessed are not yet known and these are part of live investigations the Insurance Commission is actively supporting,' an ICWA spokesperson said in a statement.

Russian-linked cybercriminals claim to have gone through with a threat to publish troves of sensitive data, after one of Australia’s largest law firms vowed not to bend to their ransom demands. Earlier this month it said it had published 1.45 terabytes on the dark web after the law firm vowed it would not bend to ransomware demands. Other clients including the big four banks and multiple state and federal government departments, including the Department of Health and Aged Care. The WA government had seven publicly-reported contracts with the firm over the last 13 years, of which only the one with ICWA is ongoing. Concern over WA data leaks That contract makes HWL Ebsworth (HWLE) part of a panel of 15 law firms which provide independent legal services to the Commission, including 'negotiating and defending actions through litigation on insurance claims'. ICWA said the firm was reviewing its data to be able to tell clients whether their information has been taken.

The Commission's CEO, Rod Whithear, said the agency was concerned, but a NSW court order prohibiting access to the leaked data meant it could not see for itself whether any of its data was taken. 'We understand a consent regime is being implemented that will allow the Insurance Commission to assess the data that may have been exfiltrated,' he said in a statement. 'We're committed to supporting any claimants who may be impacted by this incident.' Between 2017 and 2020, the firm was also paid about $280,000 for legal services relating to the replacement of technology behind WA's public transport radio network. The state government had initially signed a $200 million contract with Chinese tech company Huawei and another company to supply replacement radios for WA's public transport network. But that contract was torn up in September 2020, after the state government said US restrictions on Huawei meant it would not be able to deliver on the project.

Another soldier and a plane are behind him Officials say the Defence IT system was not the target of the hack. (Department of Defence) Link copied Share article The Department of Defence fears the personal data of personnel, such as dates of birth, may have been compromised after a communications platform used by the military was hit by a ransomware attack. Key points: Defence says there is no evidence past and present staff's data were compromised The hack occurred on an external IT provider Defence bosses warned they expected the frequency, intensity and sophistication of cyber attacks to grow Hackers have targeted the ForceNet service, which is run by an external information and communications technology (ICT) provider, with the company initially telling Defence no data of current or former personnel appeared to have been compromised. However, a source with knowledge of the investigation said Defence believed some private details such as dates of birth and dates of enlisting may have been stolen, despite early indications to the contrary from the external provider. In a message to all staff, the defence secretary and defence chief said the matter was being taken 'very seriously'. There has been a spate of cyber attacks in recent weeks, from telecommunication companies to health insurers. Medibank last week confirmed a criminal entity behind the cyber attack on the company had access to the data of at least 4 million customers, some of which included health claims. A month earlier, Optus announced a cyber attack had exposed the data of almost 10 million Australians, with significant amounts of data stolen from 2.8 million people. Minister for Defence Personnel Matt Keogh said ForceNet held up to 40,000 records. 'I think all Australians, and rightly the Australian government, is quite concerned about this sort of cyber activity that's occurring, people seeking through nefarious means to get access to others' personal data,' he said. In their email to staff, the Defence bosses were adamant the hack of ForceNet was not an attack on the department's IT systems. 'We are taking this matter very seriously and working with the provider to determine the extent of the attack and if the data of current and former APS [Australian public service] staff and ADF personnel has been impacted,' they wrote.  'If you had a ForceNet account in 2018, we urge you to be vigilant but not alarmed. 'Initial discussions with the service provider indicate there is no evidence that the data of current and former APS staff and ADF personnel has been compromised. 'We are nevertheless examining the contents of the 2018 ForceNet dataset and what personal information it contains.' Data breach penalties 'not enough' Photo shows Glove hand inserting key with asterisks into keyhole.Glove hand inserting key with asterisks into keyhole. A proposal to steeply increase penalties for serious or repeated privacy breaches is welcome but won't do enough to deter incidents like those at Optus and Medibank, privacy critics warn. The note to staff warned that Defence expected the frequency, intensity and sophistication of hacks to grow with time. It reminded staff they were not immune from attacks. Assistant Minister for Defence Matt Thistlethwaite said the attack was being taken 'very seriously', with the ADF in the process of contacting members. 'They're suggesting considering changing passwords and moving to two-factor authentication and the like, but importantly, the aim will be to support ADF personnel,' he said. 'There is no evidence of a dataset being breached at this stage.'"

    "article_text": "Exclusive: Hacker uses Telegram chatbots to leak data of top Indian insurer Star Health By Christopher Bing and Munsif Vengattil September 21, 202412:05 AM GMT+10Updated 10 days ago Item 1 of 2 Telegram chatbots created by hacker are seen in this illustration taken, September 16, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo [1/2]Telegram chatbots created by hacker are seen in this illustration taken, September 16, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab Summary Companies Star Health customer data accessible via Telegram chatbot Star Health says no widespread compromise, sensitive data secure Reuters able to download names, addresses, health details Telegram removed chatbots after Reuters query; new bots appeared Follows CEO arrest for alledgedly allowing Telegram to facilitate crime WASHINGTON/BENGALURU, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Stolen customer data including medical reports from India's biggest health insurer, Star Health, is publicly accessible via chatbots on Telegram, just weeks after Telegram's founder was accused of allowing the messenger app to facilitate crime. The purported creator of the chatbots told a security researcher, who alerted Reuters to the issue, that private details of millions of people were for sale and that samples could be viewed by asking the chatbots to divulge. Star Health and Allied Insurance (STAU.NS), opens new tab, whose market capitalization exceeds $4 billion, in a statement to Reuters said it has reported alleged unauthorized data access to local authorities. It said an initial assessment showed 'no widespread compromise' and that 'sensitive customer data remains secure'. Using the chatbots, Reuters was able to download policy and claims documents featuring names, phone numbers, addresses, tax details, copies of ID cards, test results and medical diagnoses. The ability for users to create chatbots is widely credited with helping Dubai-based Telegram become one of the world's biggest messenger apps with 900 million active monthly users. However, the arrest of Russian-born founder Pavel Durov in France last month has increased scrutiny of Telegram's content moderation and features open to abuse for criminal ends. Durov and Telegram denied wrongdoing and are addressing the criticism. The use of Telegram chatbots to sell stolen data demonstrates the difficulty the app has in preventing nefarious agents taking advantage of its technology and highlights the challenges Indian companies face in keeping their data safe. The Star Health chatbots feature a welcome message stating they are 'by xenZen' and have been operational since at least Aug. 6, said UK-based security researcher Jason Parker. Parker said he posed as a potential buyer on a online hacker forum where a user under the alias xenZen said they made the chatbots and possessed 7.24 terabytes of data related to over 31 million Star Health customers. The data is free via the chatbot on a random, piecemeal basis, but for sale in bulk form. Reuters could neither independently verify xenZen's claims nor ascertain how the chatbot creator obtained the data. In an email to Reuters, xenZen said they were in discussions with buyers without disclosing who or why they were interested. TAKEN DOWN In testing the bots, Reuters downloaded more than 1,500 files with some documents dated as recently as July 2024. 'If this bot gets taken down watch out and another one will be made available in few hours,' the welcome message read. The chatbots were later marked 'SCAM' with a stock warning that users had reported them as suspect. Reuters shared details of the chatbots with Telegram on Sept. 16 and within 24 hours spokesperson Remi Vaughn said they had been 'taken down' and asked to be informed should more appear. 'The sharing of private information on Telegram is expressly forbidden and is removed whenever it is found. Moderators use a combination of proactive monitoring, AI tools and user reports to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.' New chatbots have since appeared offering Star Health data. Star Health said an unidentified person contacted it on Aug. 13 claiming to have access to some of its data. The insurer reported the matter to the cybercrime department of its home state of Tamil Nadu and federal cyber security agency CERT-In. 'The unauthorized acquisition and dissemination of customer data is illegal, and we are actively working with law enforcement to address this criminal activity. Star Health assures its customers and partners that their privacy is of paramount importance to us,' it said in its statement. In an Aug. 14 stock exchange filing, opens new tab, Star Health, India's biggest player among standalone health insurance providers, said it was investigating an alleged breach of 'a few claims data'. Representatives for CERT-In and the Tamil Nadu cybercrime department did not respond to emailed requests for comment. UNAWARE Telegram allows individuals or organizations to store and share large amounts of data behind anonymous accounts. It also lets them create customizable chatbots which automatically provide content and features based on user requests. Two chatbots distribute Star Health data. One offers claim documents in PDF format. The other allows users to request up to 20 samples from 31.2 million datasets with a single click giving details including policy number, name and even body mass index. Among documents disclosed to Reuters were records related to the treatment of the one-year-old daughter of policyholder Sandeep TS at a hospital in the southern state of Kerala. The records included diagnosis, blood test results, medical history and a bill of nearly 15,000 rupees ($179). 'It sounds concerning. Do you know how this can affect me?' said Sandeep, confirming the documents' authenticity. He said Star Health had not notified him of any data leak. The chatbot also leaked a claim last year by policyholder Pankaj Subhash Malhotra which included ultrasound imaging test results, details of illness and copies of federal tax account and national ID cards. He also confirmed the documents were genuine and said he was not made aware of any security breach. The Star Health chatbots are part of a broader trend of hackers using such methods to sell stolen data. Of five million people whose data was sold via chatbots, India represented the largest number of victims at 12%, showed the latest survey on the epidemic conducted by NordVPN at the end of 2022. 'The fact that sensitive data is available via Telegram is natural, because Telegram is an easy-to-use storefront,' said NordVPN cybersecurity expert Adrianus Warmenhoven.

    "article_text": "Hamilton spent $5.7 million recovering from February ransomware attack: report Less than half of city's online 'applications' restored, says Deloitte. City plans to spend millions more Samantha Beattie · CBC News · Posted: Jun 18, 2024 3:54 PM EDT | Last Updated: June 19 A city building seen from outside on a sunny day. Hamilton's city hall was hit by a ransomware attack in February and is still recovering. (Terry Asma/CBC) Social Sharing Facebook X Email Reddit LinkedIn 3 comments The City of Hamilton has spent $5.7 million dealing with the ongoing impacts of a ransomware attack in February. In the first report made public about the cybersecurity incident, city staff detail the extent of the impacts and costs since it happened Feb. 25. The report will be considered by council at a general issues committee meeting Wednesday.  The $5.7 million was used for external experts, infrastructure, staffing and other costs, and the city is still in the midst of restoring services, staff say. This cost is being covered through the 2024 budget. The city also plans to spend another $33.6 million between 2025 to 2033 to strengthen the city's cybersecurity and modernize and digitize services, says the report. The city could draw money from pre-approved technology and security projects, reserves or delay some capital projects to minimize the impact on taxpayers. What do cities face when hit by a ransomware attack? Cyber experts explain, as Hamilton issue continues The ransomware attack shut down almost all city phone lines, paralyzed city council and impacted dozens of services including the bus schedule app, library WiFi and permit applications. The city maintains that there was no indication personal information was stolen.  The city decided not to pay the ransom and to rebuild its systems instead. It hasn't revealed how much the hackers were demanding.  Impacts continue for fire department, public health Of the 228 online 'applications' impacted, less than half — or 45 per cent — have been restored, although priority was given to those that were deemed 'critical,' says a presentation prepared by Deloitte for Wednesday's meeting. Deloitte is one of the companies hired by the city to respond to the incident.  It will take years for the city to fully recover, says the presentation.  Hamilton says it didn't pay ransom to cyberattackers — but won't say how much was demanded 'There is still a long road ahead, but we continue making good progress to restore and protect many of our critical networks and systems,' said City Manager Marnie Cluckie in a news release.  'We are mindful that this work comes at a cost, and are exploring all options to ensure the very best value for taxpayer money in a way that also considers both immediate needs and the future state of the city's services.' According to the report, staff are using manual processes for services that continue to be impacted, or temporarily relying on external sources like DocuSign and QuickBooks. The services that continue to be impacted include:  Permit applications and licensing Fire department records management Fire department paging and alert system  Asset management  Public health inspections Traffic signal system management Business management application suite Museum collections management Utility locate service  Corporate customer relationship management platform Facility management Point of Sale (POS) system"

(Tero Vesalainen/Shutterstock) The company behind a popular independent television station in Newfoundland and Labrador says it was hit by a cyberattack. The Newfoundland Broadcasting Company Limited says the attack has not hampered on-air operations at NTV nor at its radio station, OZFM.

The Play ransomware group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and its site on the dark web says it stole private data including budget and payroll information and client documents from NTV. The group's frequently asked questions page says that it typically encrypts data belonging to its victims so they can no longer access it, and that it will only release it and delete its copies of the stolen information if it receives a payment. Brett Callow, a cybersecurity analyst in British Columbia, says the company should take Play's threats seriously, but that it should not give the group any money unless it has no other option to restore its data.

A ransomware attack on June 3 that targeted London-based pathology services provider Synnovis severely impacted several hospitals in the city serving two million people, prompting them to declare a critical incident and cancel cancer surgeries and blood transfusions. (Azami Adiputera/Shutterstock) Social Sharing Facebook LinkedIn X Email Reddit The National Health Service in England is urging people with universal blood types to donate after a ransomware attack disrupted hospitals' ability to match patients — underlining how cyberattacks can have serious and potentially life-threatening impacts. On June 3, hackers targeted pathology services provider Synnovis with ransomware. Ransomware attacks encrypt a company's computer system, rendering it inoperable until the victim pays a fee. The attack on Synnovis severely impacted several London hospitals serving two million people, prompting them to declare a critical incident and cancel cancer surgeries and blood transfusions. On its website Monday, the National Health Service (NHS) explained the attack meant that 'affected hospitals cannot currently match patients' blood at the same frequency as usual' and that stocks of O positive and O negative blood need to be replenished as the hospitals lack the ability to quickly match patients to their correct blood type. O positive is the most common blood type and can be provided to anyone who has a positive blood type, while O negative, known as the universal blood type, can be tolerated by patients of all blood types and is especially helpful in time-sensitive emergencies. 'NHS staff are continuing to go above and beyond to minimize the significant disruption to patients following the ransomware cyberattack on Synnovis,' Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said in a statement, encouraging the public to book one of the 13,000 appointments available across the U.K. 'To help London staff support and treat more patients, they need access to O negative and O positive blood.' Paying ransom for data stolen in cyberattack bankrolls further crime, experts caution Ransomware attacks linked to deaths Hospitals and other health-care providers are targeted by ransomware gangs because disruptions to life-saving treatments can increase the pressure to pay criminals, cybersecurity expert Steve Waterhouse said. 'As we are seeing with the NHS case in the U.K., everything is put on hold, and if you have a medical condition that is time-critical, then it puts you in a bad spot.' Hospitals across Canada have been targeted by ransomware gangs for years — a cyberattack last year impacted five hospitals in southwestern Ontario at once. A bald man, wearing a white shirt and a blue tie, sits in front of bookshelves in an office. Cybersecurity expert Steve Waterhouse says hospitals and other health-care providers are targeted by ransomware because disruptions to life-saving treatments can increase the pressure to pay criminals. (CBC) The effects of cyberattacks can be serious. Experts also believe they have a body count: A 2023 study by researchers at the University of Minnesota estimated that between 42 and 67 Medicare patients died as a result of delayed care due to ransomware attacks between 2016 and 2021. Waterhouse, who is based in Quebec, said the findings of the 2023 study didn't surprise him. 'It's an indirect cause of death, because the information systems were not available, and they were not able to be taken care of in a timely manner,' he said. 'That is a big problem.' The gang behind the NHS ransomware attack is suspected to be Qilin, a Russian-speaking entity. Ransomware groups like Qilin operate almost like startups, offering their software as a service to affiliates that carry out attacks. Many gangs are believed to operate in Russia, so they are likely to remain outside the reach of Western law enforcement. SickKids Hospital systems back up and running after ransomware attack What do cities face when hit by a ransomware attack? Cyber experts explain, as Hamilton issue continues Synnovis CEO Mark Dollar said in a statement on June 4 that the London-based provider is working with law enforcement and that he is 'incredibly sorry for the inconvenience and upset this is causing to patients, service users and anyone else affected.' In the absence of legal justice, Waterhouse said this is another reminder that anyone who uses the internet — from hospitals to companies to individual users — must be prepared to recover from a ransomware attack because they are no longer theoretical or even rare. 'It is becoming a global problem for everyone, and everyone has to pitch in to enhance the environment so it's a little bit more secure,' he said.

REUTERS/Alina Smutko Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab Summary Companies Kyivstar's IT systems 'partially destroyed' CEO says attack connected to war with Russia Ukraine investigating possibility of Russian state involvement KYIV, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Ukraine's biggest mobile network operator said it hoped to restore operations by Wednesday after coming under what appeared to be the largest cyberattack since Russia launched its war on the country in February 2022. Tuesday's attack on Kyivstar, which has more than half of Ukraine's population as mobile subscribers, knocked out services, damaged IT infrastructure and put millions of people in danger of not receiving alerts of potential Russian air assaults. It also disrupted the air raid alert systems themselves in parts of Kyiv. The company's Chief Executive Officer Oleksandr Komarov said the attack was 'a result of' the war with Russia. 'War is also happening in cyberspace. Unfortunately, we have been hit as a result of this war,' he told national television. '(The attack) significantly damaged (our) infrastructure, limited access, we could not counter it at the virtual level, so we shut down Kyivstar physically to limit the enemy's access.' Komarov did not say which Russian body he believed to be responsible, but said personal data of users had not been compromised. Russian hacktivist group Killnet claimed responsibility for the attack via a statement on the Telegram messaging app, but did not provide evidence. A source close to Kyivstar said the Ukrainian military was not affected by the outage. Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency told Reuters one of the possibilities it was investigating was that of a cyber-attack conducted by Russian security services. Russia's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kyivstar, which has 24.3 million mobile subscribers, as well as more than 1.1 million home internet subscribers, said late on Tuesday that fixed-line services were partially restored and it was working to restore other services by Wednesday. 'This isn't the first attempt to breach the perimeter of the country's telecom operator, but unfortunately, this attempt has been successful,' Komarov told Forbes Ukraine. STATE ACTOR A source close to Ukraine's cyber defence agency also said that Russia was suspected to be the source of the attack, but no specific group had been identified. 'It's definitely a state actor,' said the source, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, adding that data cable interception showed 'a lot of Russian controlled traffic directed at these networks'. 'There's no ransom. It's all destruction. So it's not a financially motivated attack,' said the source. Komarov told Forbes Ukraine that Kyivstar's 'working hypothesis' was that the goal of the attack was destruction and disruption. 'Perhaps it was aimed at disrupting the president's visit to the United States, perhaps to aggravate energy blackouts, or impact the morale of Ukrainians,' he said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was in Washington on Tuesday, pleading for more U.S. military support to fight Russia. Ukrainian officials said air raid alert systems in more than 75 settlements in Kyiv region, which surrounds the capital, were affected by the cyberattack and they would announce aerial danger through loudspeakers until repair works done. Millions of Ukrainians depend also on phone alerts to warn them of possible Russian air attacks. In Kyiv, some people rushed to connect to other network providers and a small queue of customers formed at a store for Vodafone, Kyivstar's largest competitor. One man who bought a new SIM was 25-year-old PR consultant Dmytro. 'My connection has completely disappeared, my internet and my satellite navigation aren't working, I can't move around the city,' he said. Kyivstar, owned by Amsterdam-listed mobile telecoms operator Veon (VON.AS), opens new tab, said in a statement on Facebook it was cooperating with law enforcement bodies. Veon said it was also investigating the attack and it could not yet quantify the financial impact. Separately, the co-founder of Monobank, a major Ukrainian payment system, said in a social media post that his company was currently suffering a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, but that everything was 'under control'. He subsequently said that attack had been fought off. Representatives of PrivatBank and Oschadbank, two major Ukrainian financial institutions, told media outlet Hromadske that some of their ATMs and card terminals had been affected by the Kyivstar outage. Ukrainian state bodies and companies have often accused Russia of orchestrating cyberattacks against them in the past. At the war's outset, a cyberattack hit Viasat Inc (VSAT.O), opens new tab, disabling thousands of satellite internet modems across Europe and causing a huge loss in communications for Ukraine.

The malicious emails contain crypto-ransomware. Link copied Share article An extensive crypto-ransomware attack has targeted Australia Post customers and has also affected the ABC's TV studios. The hacking attack, which reportedly originated in Russia, uses fake emails containing a link which downloads malicious software. Computer users are being warned not to open any email attachments they receive. Australia Post has warned its customers about fake emails which advise that a 'courier' has been unable to deliver a parcel to their address. The email then requests the customer to open attachments which provide information about their package and asks them to go to their local post office to collect the package. Australia Post stressed to all customers that if they received such an email it should be deleted immediately. Got a confidential news tip?

'We are promptly actioning takedowns of these sites to protect customers.' An image obtained on October 7, 2014, from Symantec's website, showing a computer screenshot after a ransomware attack. (Symantec) The ABC said an 'IT security issue' affected ABC News 24 programming for half an hour on Tuesday morning. 'There was an IT security issue this morning which affected some of the ABC's broadcasting systems and created technical difficulties for ABC News 24,' it said in a statement. Crypto-ransomware attack targets Australian businesses, hits ABC broadcasting Crypto-ransomware attack targets Australian businesses, hits ABC broadcasting (Jake Sturmer) 'As a result, we broadcast stand-by programming from 9:30am before resuming live news broadcasts from Melbourne at 10:00am. 'We are now operating normally.' Telstra's Queensland media manager Matthew Martyn-Jones said while staff emails were targeted several weeks ago, they have not been affected by the latest scam. 'It's not uncommon for phishing emails to appear from time to time,' he said. 'These scams are designed by criminals who want to target staff for one reason or another. 'It's a timely reminder to people to stop and think before clicking anything that looks suspicious.' What is crypto-ransomware? Crypto-ransomware is a relatively new and increasingly pervasive type of ransomware that aims to collect personal and financial information or install a malicious virus which can 'take over' your PC. Recovery of infected systems is virtually impossible without clean backups. Ransomware is a type of software, or malware, used to extort money from victims by preventing access to their computer or files. The Federal Government's Stay Smart Online website suggests the following as the best prevention ways to avoid ransomware and other malware attacks: Use spam filters and be cautious when opening emails, especially if there are attachments. Make sure you are using a reputable, up-to-date security product. Make sure your operating system and applications are up to date and fully patched. Run a regular scan of your computer Set and use strong and unique passwords. Set passwords on all your hardware devices (modems and routers). Back up your data. Keep a backup copy of your data in a safe place, disconnected from your computer and the internet. Only visit reputable websites and online services."

    "article_text": "Cyber attacks: pharmacies, patient records targeted 'ransomware' attacks By technology reporter Jake Sturmer and Alison McClymont Topic:Cyber Crime Thu 16 Jan 2014 Thursday 16 January 2014 A hand rests on a computer mouse A hand rests on a computer mouse (ABC News: Nic MacBean) Link copied Share article Pharmacists have become the latest targets of sophisticated computer hacks known as ransomware attacks, which lock up PCs until victims pay up. Once the hackers plant the virus, the files on a computer become encrypted and unable to be accessed. Victims have a set amount of time to pay up before the files are wiped. As pharmacists go digital with health records they are becoming bigger targets and the Pharmacy Board of Australia has issued a warning about the threat. At least 10 pharmacists have been targeted in the last 18 months. Board chairman Stephen Marty says pharmacists need to be aware of the dangers if patient records are compromised. 'If that happened they can't ensure the safety of patients in terms of previous medications et cetera,' he said. 'Indeed they might not be able to access anything about this patient who might have been coming to them for years because the records have now been encrypted.' The Miami Family Medical Centre on the Gold Coast knows all too well how disruptive ransomware can be. 'It was awful,' centre owner David Woods said. He was a victim but refused to pay and managed to restore his systems with an older backup. He is concerned about the lack of guidelines for businesses about how to stay protected. 'There isn't actually a template that you can follow and say 'well, if you buy this system and this software and set it up in the following way, then you've got the best protection,' he said. Mr Marty says the Pharmacy Board compares the latest attacks to 'financial terrorism'. 'I think it's a growing threat to all business,' he said. 'It's another burden to people in business and it frustrates their attempts - you might lose financial records as well as important health records.' Ransomware attacks on the rise globally In Australia, real estate agents, councils and universities have also been victims. Sean Duca from internet security company McAfee predicts the number of attacks will soar this year. 'The escalating growth in Australia has really been around more and more samples coming out on regular basis,' he said. 'The cyber criminals are actually seeing this is as quite lucrative for them because they see it as an easy mechanism to send out an email, trick the person into clicking something and sometimes just luring [them] to go to a website and download some files that automatically encrypts their files and they simply send out a ransom.'

    "article_text": "UnitingCare cyber attack claimed by notorious ransom gang REvilc/Sodin By Rory Callinan and staff Topic:Internet Thu 6 May 2021 Thursday 6 May 2021 Silhouette of man in front of green screen displaying a Linux command window. The hackers have claimed to have made more than $100 million from their attacks on companies. (Four Corners: Cyber War) Link copied Share article Hackers claiming responsibility for an attack on health and community care provider UnitingCare Queensland have been revealed as one of the most notorious cyber ransom gangs in the world. Key points: The hackers who claimed responsibility are REvil/Sodin They have apparently attacked major companies like Apple UnitingCare says there's no evidence patients' health and safety has been compromised Last week, the Queensland healthcare provider fell victim to the cyber attack, which affected its hospitals and aged care homes. It runs the Wesley and St Andrew's hospitals in Brisbane, St Stephen's Hospital in Hervey Bay and the Buderim Private Hospital on the Sunshine Coast, and dozens of aged care and disability services throughout the state. A patient last week told the ABC they knew immediatly there was a problem when the wi-fi stopped working on April 25, then they noticed staff struggling with communication and accessing patient records. The attack has led to UnitingCare Queensland being suspended from the national My Health Record system, which allows patients to view their records online. UnitingCare Queensland has released scant information about the attack, but it is thought to involve hackers trying to take possession of systems or important information like patient records and threatening to either destroy or publish them on the dark web, unless the provider pays a ransom. So who was behind the attack? UnitingCare on Wednesday confirmed the hack had been claimed by REvil/Sodin. The gang that has been linked to multiple attacks on high-profile targets across the globe and is thought to have named itself after apocalyptic science fiction horror video game-turned movie, Resident Evil. The hackers have claimed to have made more than $100 million from their cyber attacks but confirming ransom amounts is difficult as victims do not publicise payments. Have there been other victims? An Apple company logo on a storefront Apple was also targeted by the same hackers. (AP: Kathy Willens) Yes, including major health providers in the United States, tech giant Apple and a New York law firm, which boasted clients like Madonna and Elton John. In the widely reported attack on Apple last month, REvil group, which is thought to have Russia origins or connections, claimed to have hacked an Apple supplier called Quanta. It threatened to release sensitive internal documents unless a $50 million ransom was paid. How was UnitingCare affected? The Wesley hospital at dawn. The Wesley Hospital was affected by the cyber attack. (ABC News: Stephen Cavenagh) UnitingCare Queensland's corporate affairs director Matthew Cuming said as a result, some of the organisation's digital and technology systems had been left inaccessible. But Mr Cuming said at this time there was no evidence the health and safety of patients, residents or clients had been compromised as a result of the cyber incident. 'With the assistance of leading experts and advisers, we are conducting a thorough investigation into whether patient, client, resident or employee information has been breached,'' said Mr Cuming in an email. 'The investigation is continuing and we will continue to keep the people we care for updated in this regard, in addition to employees, regulators and other stakeholders.' [Qld local edition teaser] Mr Cuming said employees had continued to be paid on time as usual. 'However, if any pay issues do occur we have established an employee payroll hotline and rapid payment system to address these issues,'' he said. He confirmed some systems had already been reinstated but was unable to say how long it would take to resolve all the issues. Last week the ABC revealed UnitingCare had been cut off from the Commonwealth's My Health Record system as a result of the hacking. A spokesperson for the Australian Digital Health Agency (ADHA), which oversees the My Health Record system said it had stopped UnitingCare Queensland's access as a precautionary measure. Are other healthcare operators vulnerable? Queensland's privacy commissioner Philip Green said he was not surprised the attack happened. 'I've been saying since my appointment that you really need to be aware and prepared,' Mr Green said. 'Telling your employees and making them aware and training them, and having a culture in the organisation that respects and protects privacy, and also is aware of some of the data security risks and issues, is really, really important — more than ever now.' 'I know the Queensland Government state hospitals were looking closely at those events and making sure that they weren't next on the track. 'The Uniting Care [breach] that's not going to be unique and other hospitals have to be vigilant about that and other healthcare systems too, to avoid that from happening to themselves.'

A Cadbury computer under ransomware attack. (Twitter: Leon Compton) Link copied Share article The Tasmanian Cadbury chocolate factory has been targeted by a ransomware attack which is affecting the company's IT system. Production at the company's Claremont facility was halted when the computer system went down about 9:30pm on Tuesday in what was described as a 'cyber attack'. The incident comes as a global malware attack is rolling out across the globe, taking out servers at Russia's biggest oil company, disrupting operations at Ukrainian banks and shutting down computers at multinational shipping and advertising firms. A photo supplied to the ABC shows a message on computer screens at the Cadbury factory instructing a ransom is to be paid in bitcoin currency. 'If you see this text then your files are no longer accessible, because they have been encrypted,' the message reads. 'Perhaps you are busy looking for a way to recover your files, but don't waste your time. 'Please follow the instructions: 1. Send $300 worth of Bitcoin to following address: 1Mz7153HMuxXTur2Rit78mGSdzaAtNbBWX. '2. Send your Bitcoin wallet ID and personal installation key to e-mail wowsmith123456@posteo.net. 'If you already purchased your key, please enter it below.' Cadbury factory in Claremont, Hobart The highly automated factory ceased production following the ransomware attack. (ABC News: Scott Ross) Expectation virus protection would be 'up to date' Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union state secretary John Short said he would have thought the Cadbury's computer system would have been protected. Cadbury chocolate blocks. A global ransomware attack is affecting companies around the world. (Supplied) 'It's a highly advanced site and highly automated. Most of the production process is controlled by computers,' he told ABC Radio Hobart. 'You'd expect that their virus protection was up to date and that they've got the right patches in place.' 'I would have thought most companies would have been right on ball when it comes to making sure their computer systems are protected, because if you're not protecting the computer systems then workers will be affected by that,' Mr Short said. 'I got to say that the information is patchy about what the problem is and how long it's likely to take to fix it.' Company 'does not know' when fix possible In a statement, Cadbury's parent company Mondelz International said they 'do not know when our systems will be restored'. 'We continue to work quickly to address the current global IT outage across Mondelz International,' the company said. 'Our teams are working offline in an effort to maintain business continuity with our customers and consumers around the world. We will share updates with our suppliers and partners as they become available. 'At this time, we do not know when our systems will be restored but we appreciate everyone's patience, understanding and partnership during this process.' The 'Petya' ransomware affecting systems globally has been likened to the same type of hacking tool used in the WannaCry ransomware attack in May before a British researcher created a kill-switch and included code known as 'Eternal Blue'.
